***Weather app***
This was created using basic HTML with bootstrap for designing.
You can find the logic/api calls in the JS folder as I'm using jquery to get the records and manipulate it.
I've only done the weather forecast part as I'm having trouble getting the set up for the geoapify.
I was planning to use the geoapify to get the coordinates but I just used fix value of the locations that was mentioned in the exam.docx to make it work.
I kept the design as simple as possible to make it look clean and not too flashy and the icons present was from the openweathermap.org.
Apologies if there was an unnecessary folders included as I was testing some stuff for the api.
